# Creating custom components

## üìù Notes

PropTypes: 

* Definition: To see some indication that we passed the wrong value to the component.
* PropTypes aren't good for production environments because they have a performance lack. We can use a package to remove propTypes in production. 
* If we are using TypeScript, it's unnecessary to use propTypes for obvious reasons (we already added types!).
