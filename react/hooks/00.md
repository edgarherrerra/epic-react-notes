## üìù Notes

React Hooks comes from 3 main problems writing code with react

- JavaScript Classes. 

For this, syntax was a challenging topic to learn. 

- Life cycle methods. 

We write the same code on different methods, like subscriptions!

- Logic Reuse (patterns)
To reuse logic, we must write a lot of standard code, like classes and another syntax declaration.
