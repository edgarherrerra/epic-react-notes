# Basic JavaScript-rendered Hello World

## 📝 Notes

React abstracts away the imperative browser API from you to give you a much more
declarative API to work with.

EH: THIS IS MIND CHANGING!

#### React Packages

One important thing to know about React is that it supports multiple platforms
(for example, native and web). Each of these platforms has its own code
necessary for interacting with that platform, and then there's shared code
between the platforms. EH: That's why we use in this case React (to create UI) and ReactDOM to interact with the Browser.

#### JSX
From https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-jsx.html

Each JSX element is just syntactic sugar for calling React.createElement(component, props, ...children). So, anything you can do with JSX can also be done with just plain JavaScript.
